# Ferro Framework

## What This Is

A production-ready, agent-first web framework for Rust. Ferro enables AI agents to build complete web applications from natural language descriptions — with reduced boilerplate, deep introspection via MCP, intelligent CLI scaffolding, session authentication, API resources, rate limiting, and real-time WebSocket broadcasting.

## Core Value

Agents can go from "I want an app that does X" to a working, deployed application with minimal friction. Every framework decision optimizes for agent comprehension and generation capability.

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] Publish to crates.io (manual step using PUBLISHING.md)
- [ ] Public announcement and marketing

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- New major features (payments, subscriptions, etc.) — focus is publishing, not feature expansion
- Frontend framework changes — React/Inertia stack stays as-is, JSON-UI is the alternative
- Database driver changes — SeaORM works, no need to replace

## Context

**Current State:**
- ~80,900 lines of Rust across 12 crates
- v4.0 added: authentication, API resources, rate limiting, WebSocket broadcasting
- Framework production-ready for crates.io publication
- Sample application demonstrating all capabilities including v4.0 features
- Comprehensive MCP introspection (34+ tools, including auth, resources, rate limiting, broadcasting)

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust 2021 edition
- Axum web framework
- SeaORM database layer
- React/Inertia.js frontend (full-stack SPA)
- JSON-UI server-side rendering (zero-JS alternative)
- Redis for queue/cache/broadcast

**Primary use case:** Agent-built applications for non-technical users. This requires:
- Patterns simple enough for agents to reliably generate
- Introspection deep enough for agents to understand existing code
- Error messages clear enough for agents to self-correct

Reference codebase documentation in `.planning/codebase/`:
- ARCHITECTURE.md — Layer breakdown and request lifecycle
- STACK.md — Dependencies and tooling
- PATTERNS.md, HOTSPOTS.md, TESTING.md, CONVENTIONS.md, DOCUMENTATION.md

## Constraints

- **Compatibility**: Existing sample app works with framework
- **Rust Edition**: 2021 edition, no nightly-only features

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Agent-first over developer-first | Non-technical users via agents is the target market | ✓ Good |
| Breaking changes acceptable | No backwards compatibility constraint allows cleaner APIs | ✓ Good |
| FerroModel derive on entities | Apply derive to entity files (auto-generated) not model files | ✓ Good |
| ValidateRules not Validate | Avoid conflict with validator crate's `Validate` derive | ✓ Good |
| Tool vs Resource for MCP | Implemented features as tools rather than MCP resources for simpler agent consumption | ✓ Good |
| Rebrand to "ferro" | Name appropriate for crates.io publication and public release | ✓ Good |
| Alias pattern for migration | Keep code imports working during phased rename | ✓ Good |
| JSON fallback opt-in | `render_with_json_fallback()` per route for security | ✓ Good |
| accepts_json() on InertiaRequest | Framework-agnostic Accept header detection | ✓ Good |
| Docs URL: docs.ferro-rs.dev | Dedicated subdomain for documentation | ✓ Good |
| db: namespace for CLI | All database commands under unified db: prefix | ✓ Good |
| UpdateBuilder consumes model | Takes self for simpler ownership, matches create pattern | ✓ Good |
| Option<Option<T>> for nullable fields | None=unchanged, Some(None)=clear, Some(Some(v))=set | ✓ Good |
| Exclude frontend/src/types/ | Directory-level gitignore over individual files | ✓ Good |
| Serde tagged enum for Component | Clean JSON with `{"type": "Card", ...}` | ✓ Good |
| Callback-based URL resolver | Keeps ferro-json-ui decoupled from framework route registry | ✓ Good |
| Sonnet default for AI generation | ~5x cost reduction vs Opus for CLI code generation | ✓ Good |
| json_ui_generate returns context | Consuming agent IS the LLM, avoids double-LLM calls | ✓ Good |
| COMPONENT_CATALOG duplicated | Cannot share code across workspace crates | ⚠️ Revisit |
| serde_json preserve_order | ResourceMap needs insertion-order field output | ✓ Good |
| Fail-open rate limiting | Availability over strictness; never block on infra failure | ✓ Good |
| WS upgrade before middleware | Upgrade needs raw hyper Request, not framework Request | ✓ Good |
| Always include error hints | Errors are developer-facing APIs, not user-facing | ✓ Good |
| 401 via FrameworkError::domain | 401 is authentication failure; Unauthorized is 403 | ✓ Good |
